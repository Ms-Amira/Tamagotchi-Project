# Tamagotchi-Project

As a player, I want to easily interact with my pet.
I'd like to feed and play with my pet.
I'd like to turn off the lights to signify bedtime.
I would also like some custimization like naming the pet and celebrating birthdays.

I used html for my tags, css for decorating and JS for functionality.

I plan on acutally animating the pet.
