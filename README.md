## Technologies Used
* I used html for my tags, css for decorating and JS for functionality.

## Next Steps
* I plan on animating the pet and having the animation filter through the growth cycle of the pet.

* I plan to have pictures of food when it's feeding time.

* I plan to dim the screen to signify bedtime when you click "sleep".

* I plan on adding a feature to name your Gigapet.

* I plan to add a progress bar to decrease as the levels decrement and increase as the levels increment.
