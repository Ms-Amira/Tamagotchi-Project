## Technologies Used
I used html for my tags, css for decorating and JS for functionality.

## Next Steps
I plan on animating the pet and having the animation filter through the growth cycle.
I'd like to have pictures of food and the lights should go out when you click "sleep".
I plan on adding a feature to name your Gigapet.
